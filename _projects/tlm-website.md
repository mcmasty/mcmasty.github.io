I decided having an online presence would be useful as I move forward, however I am not 100% clear what kind of website would best suit my needs. I have some Drupal experience from a previous project and I did a quick inspection of all the popular options today - Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, and others. They each seemed great in isolation, but intuitively I didn't feel like they were ideal fits for me. This project summary will outline how I ended up with a Jekyll based website.



## Broad Requirements and Relative Priority

My first step was to group the requirements into priority tiers, to ensure the most important considerations carried the most sway.


### Universal Tier  
- **Goal for site / what do I want out of site**  
  Currently my goal for this website is to share selected projects and writings. I like to think, I like to learn, and I like to experiment. Having a forum to share these projects connects the sometime private work of learning to something more visible.


- **What do I want visitors to do on the site**  
  From a functionality perspective, it is straight forward, two main areas I want visitors to be able to do:  
    1. Find and read content, hopefully interesting or helpful to you.  
    2. Be able to reach out to me if you want to get in touch.  


These requirements would be the same for all potential solution options. There are many ways to implement a solution to meet these requirements. As a result, there is very little influence these considerations would have in choosing one option over another.



### Tier 1

Dimensions with the most influence.  

- **Cost**  
  Whatever comes next for me, will be bootstrapped, so the least expensive, on a monthly cash-flow basis, will be preferred

- **Content**  
  Right now, the vast majority of the content I plan on authoring will be static.

- **Flexibility**   
  With so many future unknowns, I can envision having to migrate to a different solution in the future. By flexibility, I mean the ease of migrating of content, as well as ease of winding down existing site.   


### Tier 2  

Dimensions with moderate influence.  

- **Existing Skills / Resources**   
  Want continue / use existing skills to hit the ground running.

  I have used templating tools in the past (Jinja, Liquid).  

  I currently write some content in markdown, so obviously have markdwon content and experience.



- **Secondary Benefits**  
  Learning & Development...

  Through this project a goal is to gain, develop, or deepen experience with technologies used in this project.

  I have used Drupal in previous projects, so am comfortable with CMS-backed, dynamic websites. I wanted to some practical experience with static-site generators.




### Tier 3  

Dimensions with the least influence.  

- **User base**  
  Currently it is only me and I do not need a fancy user interface.

- **Ecosystem**  
  The simpler and fewer the better. Cost is the primary driver, with secondary consideration for re-use of existing platforms.

  A reminder to be mindful of the Tier 2 "Secondary Benefits" priority, if it a platform where I would like additional experience on, that influence the technology choices.


- **Classic Web Stuff**  
  Most of these will be covered by learning how to use the technology selected or re-using existing tools. That is, how hard is it to use the technology selected to build a reasonably decent looking website. As a result, these areas, while important, were not considered independently.

  - domain name ... uh, [see about page](/about/){: target="_blank"} for naming this site  
  - registry ... re-use existing provider
  - hosting ... driven by Tier 1 &  Tier 2 considerations.
  - design ...  any solution will have templates / themes, so pick a theme that seems reasonable.   
  - branding ... do the minimum amount of branding to see how things evolve and adjust along the way.  
  - UX / Navigation ... similar to "design", pick a reasonable theme; learn and adjust along the way.

- **Cost**   

- **Content**   

- **Flexibility**  
  Things have a way of changing, evolving once they are released to the wild. That is, I expect evolution once I start getting feedback.

- **User base**  
  Right now, this is a solo-endeavor.  I am comfortable with coding, markdown, using the command-line (terminal), etc.  So the lack of an admin or content editing UI is not an issue.  

- **Ecosystem**    
  In general, Fewer accounts, fewer servers  

-  **Classic Web Stuff**   ... domain name, registrar,  hosting, Design, Branding, UX / Navigation, Mobile / Responsive  

- **What do I want to do**  

- **What do I want visitors to do**  



- Misc
  - Version Controlled content
  - Re-using knowledge
    - markdown
    - templating (Jinja2, Liquid)
    - GitHub  


This website is definitely a recent project of mine.  My personal website (this one) as well as another project I am working didn't require an immediate web presence, but I knew it would soon.  After poking around many, many options, and all of them are pretty good, I wasn't ready to put down any money so I started looking at free options.  


On a few projects, which I can't yet discuss, use markdown, and Jinja templates for content, so I was looking for markdown, Jinja-esque website solutions. Jekyll seemed to be pretty close, and when I learned that GitHub pages uses Jekyll I was sold.
