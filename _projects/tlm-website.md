This website is definitely a recent project of mine.  My personal website (this one) as well as another project I am working didn't require an immediate web presence, but I knew it would soon.  After poking around many, many options, and all of them are pretty good, I wasn't ready to put down any money so I started looking at free options.  


On a few projects, which I can't yet discuss, use markdown, and Jinja templates for content, so I was looking for markdown, Jinja-esque website solutions. Jekyll seemed to be pretty close, and when I learned that GitHub pages uses Jekyll I was sold.
