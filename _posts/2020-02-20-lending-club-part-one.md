# Holding place for writing this up

I was intrigued by the Peer-to-Peer lending company [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com). I was an early adopter, setting my investor account in October of 2012. This post is neither sponsored nor an advertisement for LendingClub, it is only an analysis of the performance of my portfolio.

My portfolio is just a sampling of the total market, which for 2019 was over 4 million loans issued ([as published on the LC stats page](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics.action)).


My portfolio is roughly 1,000 loans.  There are a lot of ways to draw 1,000 loans from a pool of millions.
