Analysis of my personal portfolio performance on LendingClub, with an eye towards revising my investment strategy. As a way to arrive at the investment strategy, will analyze what has happened along the way.

Another point bubbling in the background is the low-yield environment of the current Fixed-Income products available from online brokers. Is going through the effort to find a strategy going to produce a yield better than a bond fund ETF, say [BND](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BND?p=BND&.tsrc=fin-srch){:target="_blank"}, which as a current yield of 2.67%.  It may take a few posts to get there.


## In the beginning

I was intrigued by the Peer-to-Peer lending company [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com){:target="_blank"}. I was an early adopter, setting my investor account in October of 2012. This post is neither sponsored nor an advertisement for LendingClub, it is only an analysis of the performance of my portfolio.

Putting some money in LendingClub however, was largely inspired by the mission of peer-to-peer lending - I was also a relatively early participant of [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org){:target="_blank"} with giving money to fund my [first loan in November 2006](https://www.kiva.org/lend/1147){:target="_blank"}. Having learned of peer-to-peer platform in the US, I was eager to support it, and hoped it would be successful.

In a nutshell, I was not hunting for pure returns when I started out, I was happy to vote with my dollars to encourage democratization of the financial services industry. However, in addition to feeling some moral satisfaction at helping upstarts, I did want want a reasonable return, since Lending Club is not in fact a charity. Kiva satisfies my charitable peer-to-peer desires.


## A nagging feeling  

I have always had a nagging feeling that LendingClub was underperforming for me. My portfolio has a positive return, so that is a positive note, and it has out-performed my savings account rates, yet my expectations were for a higher return.

This post is an exploration my own personal portfolio performance.

I have changed LendingClub investment strategies over the years.  In the early years, only traded notes from the secondary market, then automated invested with a suggested portfolio, then automated investing with my own blend, and now back to only traded notes, but with a specific strategy.

My initial thought was my portfolio performance was being dragged by a large number charge-offs.



**Note:** In the early years, automated investing was not allowed in my state. As a result from 2012 to 2015 I purchased notes on the secondary market without a specific strategy. I also had varying degrees of discipline to diversification, so my impatience might have led to larger investments in individual notes than was prudent.

My portfolio is just a sampling of the total market, which for 2019 was over 4 million loans issued ([as published on the LC stats page](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics.action){:target="_blank"}).


My portfolio is roughly 1,000 loans.  There are a lot of ways to draw 1,000 loans from a pool of millions.



Given the size of LendingClub


- [ ] add pie or donut chart by status (of completed notes)
- [ ] add graph of failures by (by quarter of completed notes)
- [ ] add last payment by (by quarter)


- [ ] add percentage of term at time of order to vintages  

- [ ] add link to code
