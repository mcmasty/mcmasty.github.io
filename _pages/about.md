## About the Name

First, what kind of title is **tlm13?**  

Well, `tlm13` is my very first email handle \ username, assigned to me by my college way back in the fall of 1992. Over the years, I have occasionally used `tlm13` as a placeholder, and this case, I decided to keep the monicker a bit longer. What can I say, I'm sentimental.

And about the site; I've found myself in a bit of a transition, and I'm not exactly sure what's next. This site is part of a learning, exploration, and demonstration process for me; a place to share what I am working on and what I am interested in.


## About the Content  

### Goals  
The are a number of goals for content on this site. The first is to convey information related to a topic. For example, If I am writing about a trend in the stock market, I hope to convey information, understanding, and possibly an argument or position about the stock market. The second, is a demonstration of relevant skills and abilities. Continuing with with the stock market example, what data is presented, what visualizations and charts were used, what was built and what was borrowed, and does the data support narrative. The third goal for content on this website is to expose as much of the invisible elements of projects as I can. Thinking, learning, judgement, and decisions are often invisible, but are a vital part project success. I hope to create content to make some of my thinking visible.


The aim is a well-rounded website. No single piece of content can accomplish all of the above goals. Individual pieces of content will aim at specific goals, and if executed well, the collection of pages on this website will demonstrate all goals.  


### Types
Currently, there are two main types of content on this site, **Posts** and **Projects**. [Posts](/posts) are just that, my writing on a particular topic. However, a particular post may require research, analysis, or additional supporting work. This supporting work I am summarizing as [Projects](/projects) pages. The project summaries will include a description of all the technologies used, as well as discussions of methodologies and approaches where applicable. In some cases I will include links to relevant code.

There may also be project pages that are not related to any posts. The first example is [the project around this website.]({% link _projects/tlm-website.md %})

If you are interested in specific technologies or tools, browsing the project list might be more fruitful for you.

Additional content types might be added in the future.
