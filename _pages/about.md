## About the Site

What kind of name is "In Search of Phronesis?"  

This is a long story.  I'll fill in the details with my posts in the future. I'll try to tell the punchline here. My interpretation of _Phronesis_, in the Aristotelian sense, is _decision-making wisdom_  or _practical wisdom_. In more common parlance, the ends **do not** justify the means. The means matter. What matters not merely what you do, but how you do it. By "how", I do not mean characteristics like diligence, or attention to details, or any other aspects of work quality; but how, in the context of the impact of your actions rippling out across all your interactions. How do you treat your colleagues? Are you a good teammate ? Is the result of this activity making you a worse partner for your loved ones ? A worse child? A worse parent ? How does this impact your community? Being an jerk might get you that promotion, but at what cost? Would you quit a job that is ruining your home life ?  I view these as _phronetic_ decisions.

You cannot choose the cards you are dealt, but you can choose how to play those cards. I hope to play my cards in a way that results in flourishing for as many people as possible; or at least in a way that doesn't make things harder or more painful than they need to be.  

This website is a collection of the project and activities I am involved in. They are opportunities to practice a more _phronetic_ decision making process. Sometimes there are no options but to take an unwise action, in life, in work, even in driving to the grocery store. In the aftermath, usually the question is "So now what?" To me, that is the search for phronesis... so now what?
