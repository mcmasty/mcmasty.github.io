## About the Site

First the basics, what kind of masthead title is **tlm13?**  Well, `tlm13` is
my very first email handle \ username, assigned to me by my college way back in the fall of 1992. What can I say, I'm sentimental.

I've found myself in a bit of a transition, and I'm not exactly sure what's next. This site is a place to share what I am working on and what I am interested. I think I bring some interesting skills, experiences, and approaches to the table. I am cautiously optimistic by sharing my work, perhaps some opportunities will appear, so if you have some challenges where you think I can help, let me know. I do enjoy interesting challenges.
