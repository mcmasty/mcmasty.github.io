## About the Name  
First, what kind of site name is **tlm13?**  

Well, `tlm13` is my very first email handle \ username, assigned to me by my college way back in the fall of 1992. Over the years, I have occasionally used `tlm13` as a placeholder, and in this case, I decided to keep the monicker a bit longer. What can I say, I'm sentimental.  

And about the site; I've found myself in a bit of a transition, and I'm not exactly sure what's next. This site is part of a learning, exploration, and demonstration process for me; a place to share what I am working on and what I am interested in.  


## About the Content  

### Content Types  
Currently, there are two main types of content on this site, **Posts** and **Projects**.  

- [Posts](/posts) are my writing on a particular topic. A post might be an essay, opinion, analysis, or argument. Each post might be thought of as an 'end product' which will hopefully stand on it's own.  

- [Project pages](/projects) are descriptions of the work. They may include listings of the technologies used, discussions of methodologies and approaches, or summaries of the project work itself.  

Some posts may require research, analysis, or additional supporting work. This supporting material may be summarized in related project pages. In general, when a post is supported by a project, there will be links on the post to the relevant project pages, and similarly, on project pages there will be links to the related posts. There may also be project pages that are not related to any posts. For example, [the project page around this website]({% link _projects/tlm-website.md %}) does not have a corresponding post.  

If you are interested in specific technologies or tools, browsing the project list might be more fruitful for you.

### Content Goals  
The aim is a well-rounded website. Specific content goals are presented below, and by design no single piece of content will attempt to accomplish all of the goals. Individual pieces of content will aim at specific goals, and given enough time, if executed well, the collection of pages on this website will demonstrate all the goals.  

There are a number of goals for content on this site. The first is to convey information related to a topic. For example, If I am writing about a trend in the stock market, I hope to convey information, understanding, and possibly an argument or position about the stock market. The second, is a demonstration of relevant skills and abilities; what data is presented, what visualizations and charts are used, what is built and what is borrowed, and are the arguments supported by the data. The third goal for content on this website is to expose as much of the invisible elements of projects as I can. Thinking, learning, judgement, and decisions are often invisible, but are a vital part of project success. I hope to create content that reveals some of these invisible elements of the work I've done in an attempt to make my thinking more visible.  


## Get in Touch
